                On the Ethereum network, we can receive ETH once we have an
                account. And once someone else has an account, you can send them
                ETH. Hopefully the previous examples have illustrated that.

                An app on Ethereum is a program that can also send or receive
                ETH according to its own rules. In blockchain jargon, this type
                of program is called a <strong>smart contract</strong>.

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                What does this program look like? What kinds of rules can we
                set? How can it be useful?

              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                As you might have guessed, it's a payment splitter! Whenever our
                Payment Splitter smart contract receives ETH, it'll
                automatically send the right proportion (1/3) to each person.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Now, we can use this simple program to send money to everyone at
                once, instead of individually sending everyone ETH one at a
                time.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                But how do we run this program?
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                On Ethereum, all smart contracts have their own address. To run
                this program, we just send ETH to its address, just like how we
                sent ETH to Alice or Bob. Once the program receives ETH, it will
                automatically split the funds.

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Because the split amounts are coded up, it's also very easy to
                change them.

                Let's say that Alice, Bob, and Carol all baked cookies for a
                bake sale. Alice has baked half of all the cookies, and Bob and
                Carol each baked a quarter. Let's say they take sales in ETH so
                they tell everyone to send them money to a Payment Splitter
                smart contract.

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                How can we change the Payment Splitter program to instead send
                50% to Alice, 25% to Bob, and 25% to Carol?

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                All we need to do is change the percentages we had for each
