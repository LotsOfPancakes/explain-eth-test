            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Let's get started. What is Ethereum? Ethereum is a <strong>blockchain network for sending money and running apps</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              What does that mean?
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Well, a <strong>network</strong> is a group of connected things, like a social network. As long as someone is in the network, you can reach them. Just like how on the Facebook network, you can send a message to anyone as long as they have an account.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              (I know we didn't define <strong>blockchain</strong> yet, don't worry, we'll get to it.)
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Like a social media network, we'll need an <strong>account</strong> to get started. And we'll also need some <strong>money</strong>. On Ethereum, the money that we can send around is called ETH.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
               Here, let's give you 1 ETH to get started below. (Self-evident, but I have to say it: All of this isn't real money of course, it's just for the demo)
            </p>

            {/* Balance Component */}
            <div className="my-12">
              <BalanceComponent className="max-w-md mx-auto" />
            </div>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Now that you have ETH, you'll be able to send it around to other people and even try some apps (more on this later)!
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Of course, you also need some friends to send money to. Meet Alice, Bob, and Carol. You can click on them to learn a bit more about each friend and decide who you want to send money to.
            </p>

            {/* Profile Cards */}
            <div className="my-12">
              <ProfileCards recipients={['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol']} />
            </div>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Now try sending them some ETH!
            </p>

            {/* Balance Component with Send */}
            <div className="my-12">
              <BalanceComponent 
                showSendAction={true} 
                allowedRecipients={['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol']}
                className="max-w-md mx-auto" 
              />
            </div>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Nice! You'll notice that after sending ETH, we get this pop-up:
            </p>

            {/* Dummy Transaction Modal */}
            <div className="my-12">
              <DummyTransactionModal />
            </div>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Once it turns green, this lets you know that the action you took was successful.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You may have noticed it takes a bit of time to finish sending someone ETH. It's not as long as a bank transfer, but it's definitely a bit slower than for example a Venmo transfer.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Specifically, on Ethereum, it takes <b>around 12 seconds</b> to complete a transaction.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              This delay is called the <strong>block time</strong>. For a blockchain, the block time describes about how long you have to wait from when you take an action until when it's <b>confirmed</b>.
